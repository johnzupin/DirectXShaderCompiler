 otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
 outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
 .
 "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
 exercising permissions granted by this License.
 .
 "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
 including but not limited to software source code, documentation
 source, and configuration files.

 and conversions to other media types.
 .
 "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
 Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
 copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
 (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 .
 "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
 the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 .
 "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
 the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
 to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
 submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
 or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
 the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
 means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
 to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
 communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
 and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
 Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
 excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
 designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
 .
 "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
 on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
 subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 .
 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
 publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
 Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 .
 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
 where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
 by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 as of the date such litigation is filed.
 .
 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 meet the following conditions:
 .
 (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 .
 (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 stating that You changed the files; and
 .
 (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
 that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 the Derivative Works; and
 .
 (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 as modifying the License.
 .
 You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 the conditions stated in this License.
 .
 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 .
 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 .
 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 .
 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 .
 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 .

License: GPL-2+ with AutoConf exception
 Autoconf Exception
 .
 As a special exception, the Free Software Foundation gives unlimited permission to copy, distribute and modify the configure scripts that are the output of Autoconf. You need not follow the terms of the GNU General Public License when using or distributing such scripts, even though portions of the text of Autoconf appear in them. The GNU General Public License (GPL) does govern all other use of the material that constitutes the Autoconf program.
 .
 Certain portions of the Autoconf source text are designed to be copied (in certain cases, depending on the input) into the output of Autoconf. We call these the "data" portions. The rest of the Autoconf source text consists of comments plus executable code that decides which of the data portions to output in any given case. We call these comments and executable code the "non-data" portions. Autoconf never copies any of the non-data portions into its output.
 .
 This special exception to the GPL applies to versions of Autoconf released by the Free Software Foundation. When you make and distribute a modified version of Autoconf, you may extend this special exception to the GPL to apply to your modified version as well, *unless* your modified version has the potential to copy into its output some of the text that was the non-data portion of the version that you started with. (In other words, unless your change moves or copies text from the non-data portions to the data portions.) If your modification has such potential, you must delete any notice of this special exception to the GPL from your modified version.
